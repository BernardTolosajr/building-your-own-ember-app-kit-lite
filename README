A simple ember.js app used to build your own EAK-lite


To run the ember.js application locally

    npm install

    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

    grunt local (includes a watch task)

    ./bin/server (open in another tab as grunt local is blocking)

    visit http://localhost:3000 to see the running app


To run the qunit tests

    npm install

    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

    grunt test


To deploy the web application

    npm install

    export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

    grunt deploy
